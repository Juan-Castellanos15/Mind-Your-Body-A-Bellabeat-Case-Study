Bellabeat is a successful high-tech company that specializes in health-focused smart products for women. While the company offers a range of smart devices, the goal of this analysis was to help Bellabeat develop effective marketing strategies to promote their fitness tracker app based on the insights obtained from analyzing user data. The analysis focused on the correlation between physical activity and sleep patterns, with additional emphasis on the importance of daily step count and its correlation with calories burned. Based on the insights obtained, marketing strategies were proposed, including personalized recommendations, gamification, emphasizing the benefits of tracking daily step count, promoting weight loss, and highlighting the app's ability to optimize workouts and achieve fitness goals faster. The goal of these strategies is to increase user engagement, drive sales, and promote the app as a tool to help users improve their health and well-being.

According to the co-founder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, analyzing data from smart devices has the potential to uncover new opportunities for the company's growth. As a data analyst, I have been assigned the responsibility of conducting an analysis of smart device data to gain insights into consumer usage patterns. Specifically, for this project, I will be analyzing data from a non-Bellabeat device, the Fitbit.
